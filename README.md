# Rust chessbot
As a personal project, I immersed myself in the tedious era of learning a new programming language: Rust. So far, so good.

## About this project
This project consists of the development of a chess AI and board environment that could handle a game against a human or another AI.

## Running the project

Clone this repository and execute Â ```cargo run ``` in your cli of preference, making sure to have rust and cargo installed.
